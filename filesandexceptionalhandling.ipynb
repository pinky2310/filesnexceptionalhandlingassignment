It tracks the number of references to each object, reclaiming memory when the count drops to zero. To handle cyclical references, Python employs generational garbage collection, which categorizes objects by age and focuses on younger objects more frequently. The \"mark and sweep\" algorithm identifies unreachable objects by marking live ones and sweeping away the unmarked ones. This system automates memory management, helping prevent memory leaks and allowing developers to focus on coding."
